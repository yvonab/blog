I came across Steward ownership through my student initiative - PPE Encounters. We hold events for students to engage with experts from different backgrounds, bringing in various ideas and opinions.

We invited guests from [**Purpose economy **]()to talk about their work and the change they are trying to bring about in our economy.

##### Steward ownership is the idea that a company is owned by itself, and its profits are either reinvested or donated. This shifts the company’s motivation from profit-making (as an end in itself) to focus on its mission.

There are many companies that follow this model, for example Ecosia, Zeiss, and many more.

Recognised benefits:

* Higher company survival rate and crisis resilience
* Better profitability, higher wages
* More focus on environment and corporate responsibility
* Employees and managers stay longer
* High intrinsic motivation of employees - they do not work for the owner’s profit but the business’ goal
* Power decentralisation
